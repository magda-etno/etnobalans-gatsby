Thanks to our friends (dancers, musicians, storytellers, teachers) we managed to create an educational program that is thoughtful, fun and fascinating. So far we have managed to discover such regions of the world as: Africa, America, Arab countries, Brazil, France, Hawaii, India, Israel, Ireland, the Philippines, Poland, Spain.",
