Creative and inspiring activities for children aged 5-12 years combine dance, music, singing, linguistic games, art plays and many other exciting activities. Thanks to our friends (dancers, musicians, storytellers, teachers) we managed to create an educational program that is thoughtful, fun and fascinating. So far we have managed to discover such regions of the world as: Africa, America, Arab countries, Brazil, France, Hawaii, India, Israel, Ireland, the Philippines, Poland, Spain.",
