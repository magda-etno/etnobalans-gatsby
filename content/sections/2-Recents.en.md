The class will be a combination of various techniques of mindful body work and percussive dance, not limited to a particular style or technique. The aim of the class is to search for the dance technique that best suits us and to support courage of self-expression.",

Too many of us remain silent. Because of fear, stress, lack of awareness, helplessness, awareness of being judged or simply because of lack of people who are ready to listen to us. With our project we want to stimulate, especially among women, the readiness both to listen carefully and to use their own voice.",

During each class we will learn a new set of steps, so you can come to selected classes without worrying that you won't know what it's all about.

    content: "Sean nós (old style) Irish dance style gained its name about 20 years ago, coming from rural areas of Ireland, where the tradition of dance and music was a natural need and way of social entertainment. Recently it has become more and more popular, probably because of its spontaneity and freedom of expression. Leg movements are small and less spacious, close to the floor and the body is relaxed from the waist up. Since it is an improvised form, each dancer presents his own unique style. The dancers Sean nós stay in close contact with the musicians and everyone reacts to what is happening here and now. The desire to combine the energy of dancers and musicians whose passions are the Irish climate and the desire to seek dialogue between them inevitably pushes us to try to work out a regular space for this :)",
