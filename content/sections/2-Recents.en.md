    content: "After a 2-year break from live dance balls in Poznan we announce the resurrection of our long-standing tradition. This year's edition will be a bit more intimate than previous meetings and marked by the spirit of support for Ukrainians. Each of us now needs to take care of ourselves as well, and moving together is always a good way to self-regulate. So bring your sadness, helplessness, piss, grief, fear and any other emotions and we will tame them with mutual support. We must admit that the Irish are a nation that in its turbulent history has constantly drawn strength from the restorative and heart-soothing healing power of poetry, music and dance. We refer to their tradition.",

The class will be a combination of various techniques of mindful body work and percussive dance, not limited to a particular style or technique. The aim of the class is to search for the dance technique that best suits us and to support courage of self-expression.",

    content: "To be heard is to be noticed. Sharing your story with a non-judgmental, accepting and compassionate person can be a truly therapeutic, soul-healing experience. Too many of us remain silent. Because of fear, stress, lack of awareness, helplessness, awareness of being judged or simply because of lack of people who are ready to listen to us. With our project we want to stimulate, especially among women, the readiness both to listen carefully and to use their own voice.",
