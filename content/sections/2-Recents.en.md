    content: "Sean nós (old style) Irish dance style gained its name about 20 years ago, coming from rural areas of Ireland, where the tradition of dance and music was a natural need and way of social entertainment. Recently it has become more and more popular, probably because of its spontaneity and freedom of expression. Leg movements are small and less spacious, close to the floor and the body is relaxed from the waist up. Since it is an improvised form, each dancer presents his own unique style. The dancers Sean nós stay in close contact with the musicians and everyone reacts to what is happening here and now. The desire to combine the energy of dancers and musicians whose passions are the Irish climate and the desire to seek dialogue between them inevitably pushes us to try to work out a regular space for this :)",
