Development of skills and new stimuli is one thing, but we have come to the conclusion that the concept of experiencing movement, dancing and sounding together without clear divisions into levels and age categories is very important to us. We are quite excited and curious to see what such encounters will bring us.",

Everyone regardless of age, skill level, hair colour or favourite ice cream flavour is welcome and wanted. In the first hour of the class we will remind you of the basic steps plus dance the simpler Irish group dances, in the second hour we will turn up the level of complexity.",
